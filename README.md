To allow others to integrate your Google Calendar into their own calendar applications, they can follow these steps using the embed link you provided:

1. **Provide the Embed Link**:
   - Share the following link with the individuals who want to integrate your calendar into their own:
     ```
     https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c911ce988e18e89997b0d0d995fb1be52f442e04b80253cc341d014b69622991%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia%2FKolkata
     ```
   - Make sure they have access to this link.

2. **Instructions for Users**:
   - Users can open their preferred calendar application (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.).
   - In Google Calendar, they can follow these specific steps:
     - Click on the "+" sign next to "Other calendars" on the left side panel.
     - Select "From URL".
     - Paste the provided link into the field and click "Add Calendar".
     - Your calendar will now appear in their list of calendars under "Other calendars".

3. **For Non-Google Calendar Applications**:
   - For other calendar applications like Outlook or Apple Calendar, users can usually find an option to subscribe to a calendar by URL or by importing a calendar.
